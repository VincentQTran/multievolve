# Example data

## Training dataset

CSV file with columns ```mutation``` and ```property_value```. Variants should be formatted as ```A40P/E61Y```, or for protein complexes as ```A40P/E61Y:WT```, where ```:``` separates the individual chains (e.g. chain 1 mutations:chain 2 mutations), ```/``` separates the individual mutations, and ```WT``` indicates the wildtype sequence.

## Multi-chain protein

The variable heavy domain (vh) and variable light domain (vl) chains of HuABC2, anti-CD122 antibody. 

## Single chain protein

Engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APEX)
